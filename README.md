KISS method in mind

Planned thingz:
    1. Crests
       - Ideally I would like the crests to always show the highest value and chomp the lowest. 
           -     e.g.  Vet X Champ Y Hero Z
           - Then when you get a Myth crest it would change layout to
            -    e.g. Champ X Hero Y Myth Z 
           - Hiding the ones you dont need anymore
    2.Edit Mode Menu w/ Lib Edit mode, color changer (class or a chosen color), gold icons or txt (g,s,c)
